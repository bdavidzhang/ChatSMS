#ChatSMS - basic chat template for agents to text over SMS!

I've had a few ideas in mind for building agents that text! Here's the basic template that can be tailored towards 
most chatting features.

To get started:
1. sign up for a twilio account at [https://www.twilio.com/en-us](twilio)
2. create a .env file holding your APIs
3. download ngrok
4. run the app and forward the port to ngrok using `ngrok http 5001`
5. setup webhooks on twilio, and you're all set!
